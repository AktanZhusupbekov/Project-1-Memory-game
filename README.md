Welcome to the Memory Game! Put your mind to the test and sharpen your recall as you uncover matching pairs of numbers in this classic brain teaser. Get ready for a journey of concentration and discovery!

Objective:

Your goal is to match all the pairs of numbers using the fewest guesses. Every number appears twice, hidden amongst a grid of face-down cards. Can you remember where each number lurks and reunite them all?

Game Setup:

A grid of numbers awaits you, each representing a unique card.
All cards are initially face down, concealing their secrets.
You have complete freedom to explore the grid, one flip at a time.
Game Rules:

Each turn, you guess two different cards by entering their array indices.
Remember the indices! They'll be your keys to unlocking the hidden pairs.
If the numbers on the two cards match, they'll flip over and stay revealed, a victory of memory!
But if the numbers don't match, don't fret! We simply flip them back down, waiting for another chance to be reunited.
The game continues until all pairs have been successfully matched.
How to Play:

Observe the grid: Familiarize yourself with the numbers before diving in.
Make your choice: Enter the indices of the two cards you wish to flip (e.g., "3 5").
Reveal the cards: Watch as the chosen cards turn over, revealing their numbers.
Match or miss?: If the numbers match, you've found a pair! If not, don't worry, try again.
Keep guessing: Continue using your memory and deduction skills to uncover all the matching pairs.
Victory and Beyond:

When all pairs are revealed, celebrate your sharp mind and memory!
The game will display the total number of guesses you took to achieve victory.

Remember:

The key to success lies in paying close attention, remembering card locations, and strategizing your guesses.
Don't get discouraged by missed matches â€“ persistence is key!
Have fun, challenge yourself, and enjoy the satisfaction of uncovering all the hidden pairs!
